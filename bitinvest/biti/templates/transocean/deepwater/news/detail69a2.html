Holders of Notes validly tendering their Notes (and validly delivering their Consents, if applicable) after the Early Tender Date will not be eligible to receive the Early Tender Premium.</p><p align=\"justify\">In conjunction with certain of the Tender Offers, <org>Transocean Inc.</org> has also commenced solicitations (each a “Consent Solicitation” and, collectively, the “Consent Solicitations”) of consents (each a “Consent” and, collectively, the “Consents”) from holders of Notes due in 2020, 2021 and 2022 to amend certain provisions (the “Proposed Amendments”) of the indenture, dated as of <chron>December 11, 2007</chron> (as supplemented, the “Indenture”), between <org>Transocean Inc.</org> and <org>Wells Fargo Bank</org>, National Association, as trustee.

If <org>Transocean Inc.</org> changes the Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount or the 2023 Tender Cap, it does not expect to extend the Withdrawal Deadline, subject to applicable law.</p><p align=\"justify\"><org>Transocean Inc.</org> reserves the right, but is under no obligation, at any point following the Early Tender Date and before the Expiration Date, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitations, to accept for purchase any Notes validly tendered (with Consents that have been validly delivered, if applicable) and not validly withdrawn (or Consents revoked) at or prior to the Early Tender Date (the settlement date of such purchase being the “Early Settlement Date”), subject to the Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount, the 2023 Tender Cap, the Acceptance Priority Levels and proration.

The Final Settlement Date is expected to occur on <chron>February 4, 2019</chron>, the second business day following the Expiration Date.</p><p align=\"justify\">Subject to the Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount, the 2023 Tender Cap and proration, the Notes accepted on any Settlement Date will be accepted in accordance with their Acceptance Priority Levels set forth in the table above, with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and 4 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level. All Notes tendered at or before the Early Tender Date will be accepted for purchase in priority to Notes tendered after the Early Tender Date, even if such Notes tendered after the Early Tender Date have a higher Acceptance Priority Level than Notes tendered prior to the Early Tender Date.</p><p align=\"justify\">Acceptance for tenders of any Notes may be subject to proration if the aggregate principal amount for any series of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn would result in an Aggregate Purchase Price that exceeds the Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount. Acceptance for tenders of 2023 Notes may be subject to proration if the aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn would exceed the 2023 Tender Cap. In the event of any proration of a series of Notes, if there is a Consent Solicitation with respect to such series of Notes, the Consents delivered with respect to such series of Notes shall be null and void and the Requisite Consent (as defined below) will be deemed not to have been obtained with respect to such series of Notes. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered at or before the Early Tender Date results in an Aggregate Purchase Price that equals or exceeds the Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount, <org>Transocean Inc.</org> will not accept for purchase any Notes tendered after the Early Tender Date, and if the aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes validly tendered at or before the Early Tender Date equals or exceeds the 2023 Tender Cap, <org>Transocean Inc.</org> will not accept for purchase any 2023 Notes tendered after the Early Tender Date, unless the Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount or the 2023 Tender Cap is increased, as applicable.</p><p align=\"justify\">None of the Tender Offers is conditioned upon the tender of a minimum amount of Notes of any series being tendered, the consummation of any other Tender Offer in respect of any other series of Notes or obtaining any Requisite Consent. The adoption of the Proposed Amendments with respect to the applicable series of Notes is not conditioned upon the consummation of any other Consent Solicitation or adoption of the Proposed Amendments in respect of any other series of Notes or obtaining any Requisite Consent with respect to any other series of Notes. However, the Tender Offers are subject to, and conditioned upon, the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions described in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation and the accompanying Letter of Transmittal and Consent.</p><p align=\"justify\"><org>Transocean Inc.</org> intends to execute a supplement to the Indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture”) with <org>Wells Fargo Bank</org>, National Association with respect to the Proposed Amendments applicable to a series of Notes if the requisite consents to effect such Proposed Amendments (the “Requisite Consents”) are received and not revoked or nullified with respect to such series of Notes, as described in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation and the accompanying Letter of Transmittal and Consent. Assuming that the Requisite Consents applicable to a series of Notes are received and not revoked or nullified, it is expected that the Supplemental Indenture will be entered into promptly following the later of the receipt of such Requisite Consents and the Withdrawal Deadline with respect to such series of Notes. The Supplemental Indenture will effect the Proposed Amendments only with respect to such series of Notes for which the applicable Requisite Consents were received and not revoked or nullified.</p><p align=\"justify\">The Supplemental Indenture will become effective upon execution but will provide that the Proposed Amendments applicable to a series of Notes will not become operative unless <org>Transocean Inc.</org> accepts the applicable Notes satisfying the Requisite Consent with respect to such series of Notes required for purchase in the applicable Tender Offer. The Proposed Amendments constitute a single proposal with respect to each applicable series of Notes, and a consenting holder of Notes must deliver a Consent to the Proposed Amendments with respect to such series of Notes as an entirety and may not consent selectively with respect to certain of the Proposed Amendments applicable to a series of Notes.</p><p align=\"justify\"><org>Transocean Inc.</org> may amend, extend or, subject to certain conditions and applicable law, terminate each Tender Offer or Consent Solicitation at any time in its sole discretion.</p><p align=\"justify\">Full details of the terms and conditions of the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitations are described in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation and the accompanying Letter of Transmittal and Consent, which are being sent by <org>Transocean Inc.</org> to holders of the Notes.
