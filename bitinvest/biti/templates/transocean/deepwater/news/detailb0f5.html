This represents a 20.4% premium to Ocean Rig’s ten-day volume weighted average share price. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of each company.</p><p><org value=\"NYSE:RIG\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Transocean</org> intends to fund the cash portion of the transaction consideration through a combination of cash on hand and fully committed financing provided by Citi. The merger is not subject to any financing condition.</p><p>Upon completion of the merger, Transocean’s and Ocean Rig’s shareholders will own approximately 79% and approximately 21%, respectively, of the combined company.</p><p>Ocean Rig’s fleet is comprised of nine high-specification ultra-deepwater drillships and two harsh environment semisubmersibles. Additionally, its fleet includes two high-specification ultra-deepwater drillships currently under construction at <org>Samsung Heavy Industries</org> with favorable shipyard financing terms. These two newbuilds are expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2020, respectively.</p><p align=\"left\">“The proposed acquisition of <org>Ocean Rig</org> provides us with a unique opportunity to continue enhancing our fleet of ultra-deepwater and harsh environment floaters, without compromising our liquidity or overall balance sheet flexibility,” said Transocean’s President and Chief Executive Officer, <person>Jeremy Thigpen</person>. “The combination of constructive and stable oil prices over the last several quarters, streamlined offshore project costs, and undeniable reserve replacement challenges has driven a material increase in offshore contracting activity. As such, adding Ocean Rig’s premium assets to our industry-leading fleet provides us with an increased number of the modern and highly efficient ultra-deepwater drillships preferred by our customers, and better positions us to capitalize on what, we believe, is an imminent recovery in the ultra-deepwater market.”</p><p align=\"left\">Thigpen continued, “This combination with <org>Ocean Rig</org> further strengthens our relationships with strategic customers, while expanding our presence in the key markets of <location value=\"LC/br;LB/sam\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Brazil</location>, <location value=\"LR/wafr\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">West Africa</location> and Norway. It also enables us to reduce our cost per active rig, as we believe that we can efficiently merge the <org>Ocean Rig</org> operations into our existing structure with limited incremental shore-based expense. Further, we are confident that we can realize meaningful synergies through our OEM agreements, our overall approach to maintenance and our fleet-wide insurance coverage, among other opportunities.”</p><p align=\"left\">Thigpen concluded, “Including the five rigs under construction, and considering the two additional rigs that we have recently decided to recycle, Transocean’s pro forma fleet will be comprised of 57 floaters, including many of the most technically capable ultra-deepwater floaters, and harsh environment semisubmersibles in the industry. With this unparalleled fleet, the offshore drilling industry’s largest and most profitable backlog totaling <money>$12.5 billion</money>, and approximately <money>$3.7 billion</money> in liquidity, we are well-equipped for the market recovery.”</p><p><person>Pankaj Khanna</person>, President and Chief Executive Officer of <org value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:ORIG\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Ocean Rig UDW Inc.</org> commented: \"This strategic combination of <org>Ocean Rig</org> and <org value=\"NYSE:RIG\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Transocean</org> creates a world-class fleet perfectly positioned for the market recovery while reducing fragmentation that currently exists in offshore drilling. By adding our high-specification floaters to <org value=\"NYSE:RIG\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Transocean's</org> industry-leading fleet, the combined company will have the offshore industry’s largest and most technically capable fleet of ultra-deepwater and harsh environment floaters. Upon consummation, this transaction will be of significant benefit to the stakeholders of both companies.\"</p><p>No changes to Transocean’s board of directors, executive management team, or corporate structure are anticipated as a result of the acquisition. The Company will remain headquartered in Steinhausen, <location value=\"LC/ch;LB/weur\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Switzerland</location>, with significant operating presence in <location value=\"LU/us.tx.houstn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Houston, Texas</location>, <location value=\"LU/gb.sco.aberde\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Aberdeen, Scotland</location> and Stavanger, <location value=\"LC/no;LB/neur\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Norway</location>.</p><p>The transaction, which is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2019, is subject to the approval of both <org value=\"NYSE:RIG\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Transocean</org> and <org>Ocean Rig</org> shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals. The merger is not subject to any financing condition.</p><p>Also, consistent with the Company’s strategy of recycling less competitive rigs, <org value=\"NYSE:RIG\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Transocean</org> will retire two of its floaters, the ultra-deepwater drillship <em><person>C.R. Luigs</person></em> and the midwater floater <em>Songa Delta</em>. The rigs will be classified as held for sale and will be recycled in an environmentally responsible manner. Both floaters are currently stacked. <org value=\"NYSE:RIG\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Transocean</org> anticipates re-ranking the combined fleet, which may result in additional rigs being recycled.</p><p align=\"justify\">   <sup>(1) </sup>Per Transocean’s internal rig ranking model</p><p><strong>Advisors</strong></p><p>Citi is acting as exclusive financial advisor to <org value=\"NYSE:RIG\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Transocean</org>, and <org>King &amp; Spalding LLP</org> is acting as legal advisor to <org value=\"NYSE:RIG\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Transocean</org> with respect to U.S. law.</p><p><org>Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC</org> is acting as financial advisor to <org>Ocean Rig</org>. <org>Seward &amp; Kissel LLP</org> is acting as legal advisor to <org>Ocean Rig</org> with respect to U.S. law.</p><p><strong>Conference Call Information</strong></p><p><org value=\"NYSE:RIG\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Transocean</org> will conduct a teleconference call to discuss this transaction at <chron>8:30 a.m. EDT</chron>, <chron>2:30 p.m. CEST</chron>, on <chron>Tuesday, September 4, 2018</chron>.
