        <h1 class="news-title">Transocean Ltd. Announces Early Results, Extension of Early Tender Time, Amendment to Exchange Offers and Termination of Consent Solicitations</h1>
        <div class="news-date">August 24, 2020</div>
        <p align=\"justify\">STEINHAUSEN, <location value=\"LC/ch\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Switzerland</location>, <chron>Aug.  24, 2020</chron>  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <org value=\"NYSE:RIG\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Transocean Ltd.</org> (NYSE: RIG) announced today that <org value=\"ACORN:0303402573\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Transocean Inc.</org>, its wholly-owned subsidiary (collectively with <org value=\"NYSE:RIG\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Transocean Ltd.</org>, “Transocean”), has amended its previously announced exchange offers (the “Exchange Offers”) to exchange certain existing notes (the “Existing Notes”) for up to an aggregate principal amount of <money>$750 million</money> (subject to increase or decrease by <org value=\"ACORN:0303402573\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Transocean Inc.</org>, the “Maximum New Notes Amount”) of new notes (the “New 2027 Senior Guaranteed Notes”) issued by <org value=\"ACORN:0303402573\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">Transocean Inc.</org>, and terminated the related solicitation of consents (the “Consent Solicitations” and, together with the Exchange Offers, the “Offers”).<br></p><p align=\"justify\">As of <chron>5:00 p.m.</chron>, <location value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">New York City</location> time, on <chron>August 21, 2020</chron> (the “Original Early Tender Time”), <money>$1.13 billion</money> in aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes had been validly tendered or committed to be tendered pursuant to support agreements described below. Based on the amended total consideration described below, and the amounts tendered or committed to be tendered to date, approximately <money>$518 million</money> aggregate principal amount of New 2027 Senior Guaranteed Notes would be issued upon closing the Exchange Offers. Transocean intends to accept for exchange Existing Notes validly tendered prior to the Expiration Time, subject to the Maximum New Notes Amount and the Acceptance Priority Levels.</p><p align=\"justify\">According to information received from <org value=\"ACORN:4002833135\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\">D.F. King &amp; Co., Inc.</org>, the exchange agent and information agent for the Offers, as of the Original Early Tender Time, <money>$780.4 million</money> in aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes had been validly tendered in the Offers. In addition, in connection with the amendments to the Offers, certain Eligible Holders have entered into support agreements whereby they have committed to tender and exchange approximately <money>$350 million</money> aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes (the “Committed Notes”) to be issued in connection with the amended Offers. To the extent certain Committed Notes are not accepted for purchase in the Offers due to proration, Transocean has agreed to separately exchange such Committed Notes for up to an additional <money>$32 million</money> principal amount of New 2027 Senior Guaranteed Notes on the same terms and conditions had such Committed Notes been accepted for purchase in the amended Offers.</p><p align=\"justify\">The terms and conditions of the amended Offers are described in a supplement, dated <chron>August 24, 2020</chron> (the “Supplement”), which supplements Transocean’s Exchange Offer Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated <chron>August 10, 2020</chron> (as supplemented, the “Exchange Offer Memorandum”). The Supplement amends the Offers as follows:</p><p align=\"justify\">(i) The Offers with respect to the 6.375% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”) and the 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Notes”) are amended to provide that the consideration payable with respect to an exchange of each such series of Existing Notes shall be the 11.50% Senior Guaranteed Notes due 2027 instead of the previously contemplated 10.00% Senior Guaranteed Notes due 2025.</p><p align=\"justify\">(ii) The Offers with respect to certain series of Existing Notes are amended as indicated in the table below to increase the consideration payable with respect to an exchange thereof, such that, subject to the terms and conditions of each such Offer, the total consideration for each <money>$1,000</money> principal amount of such series of Existing Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Expiration Time and accepted for exchange pursuant to such Offer will be as indicated in the table below (with respect to such series of Existing Notes, the “<em>Revised Consideration</em>”).</p><table class=\"gnw_table_border_collapse hugin\" style=\"width:100%; border-collapse:collapse !important;\">  <tr>
